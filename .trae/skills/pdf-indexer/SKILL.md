# PDF Indexer

This skill specializes in extracting technical content from PDF documents, summarizing key points, and identifying architectural patterns or "technical debt" (LOD - Level of Detail/Debt).

## Usage
1. Identify the PDF file path.
2. Use terminal tools (like pdftotext or similar, if available) or content analysis to summarize.
3. Generate structured summaries or Markdown files like LOD.md.
